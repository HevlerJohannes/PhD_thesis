\section{Curriculum vitae}
I was born on the 12\textsuperscript{th} of December 1992 in Karlsruhe, Germany. After finishing high school in 2011, I worked and traveled before starting my Bachelor studies in Biotechnology in Berlin in 2013. During my studies I developed a strong interest in the structural characterization of proteins and protein complexes. The completion of my studies was marked by writing my Bachelor thesis entitled “\emph{Structural and functional analysis of spliceosomal Brr2-RNA-Helicase and its interaction partners}”, which I conducted in the research group of Prof. dr. Markus Wahl (Freie Universität Berlin). In 2016, I moved to Frankfurt am Main to pursue my Master studies, to further strengthen my structural biology toolshed. Amongst other research projects, I continued focusing on the structural characterization of protein and protein complexes using nuclear resonance microscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography within the group of Prof. dr. Wöhnert (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main). Realizing the importance of studying proteins and protein complexes in-vivo, I joined the research group of Dr. Mikhail Savitski (EMBL, Heidelberg) to conduct my Master thesis research entitled "\emph{Untangling the function of Escherichia coli genes by thermal proteome profiling (TPP)}". I applied mass spectrometry based techniques to shed further light on the function of a number of bacterial genes. Following my graduation in 2018, I moved to Utrecht, the Netherlands, and started a Ph.D. in the Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry group under the supervision of Albert J.R. Heck in February 2019. Leveraging experiences gained in structural biology and mass spectrometry, we aimed at applying different structural proteomics techniques to structurally characterize novel proteins and protein complexes in mitochondria. Parts of the research performed during my PhD are presented in this thesis.
