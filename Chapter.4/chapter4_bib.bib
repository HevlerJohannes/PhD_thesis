abstract = {Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine A and FK506, are used as immunosuppressant drugs, but their adverse effects on male reproductive function remain unclear. The testis expresses somatic calcineurin and a sperm-specific isoform that contains a catalytic subunit (PPP3CC) and a regulatory subunit (PPP3R2). We demonstrate herein that male mice lacking Ppp3cc or Ppp3r2 genes (knockout mice) are infertile, with reduced sperm motility owing to an inflexible midpiece. Treatment of mice with cyclosporine A or FK506 creates phenocopies of the sperm motility and morphological defects. These defects appear within 4 to 5 days of treatment, which indicates that sperm-specific calcineurin confers midpiece flexibility during epididymal transit. Male mouse fertility recovered a week after we discontinued treatment. Because human spermatozoa contain PPP3CC and PPP3R2 as a form of calcineurin, inhibition of this sperm-specific calcineurin may lead to the development of a reversible male contraceptive that would target spermatozoa in the epididymis.},

abstract = {Reminiscent of bacterial quorum sensing, mammalian mitochondria participate in inter-organelle communication. However, physical structures that enhance or enable interactions between mitochondria have not been defined. Here we report that adjacent mitochondria exhibit coordination of inner mitochondrial membrane cristae at inter-mitochondrial junctions (IMJs). These electron-dense structures are conserved across species, resistant to genetic disruption of cristae organization, dynamically modulated by mitochondrial bioenergetics, independent of known inter-mitochondrial tethering proteins mitofusins and rapidly induced by the stable rapprochement of organelles via inducible synthetic linker technology. At the associated junctions, the cristae of adjacent mitochondria form parallel arrays perpendicular to the IMJ, consistent with a role in electrochemical coupling. These IMJs and associated cristae arrays may provide the structural basis to enhance the propagation of intracellular bioenergetic and apoptotic waves through mitochondrial networks within cells.},

abstract = {The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the most abundant protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Due to its localization, VDAC is involved in a wide range of processes, such as passage of ATP out of mitochondria, and particularly plays a central role in apoptosis. Importantly, the assembly of VDAC provides interaction with a wide range of proteins, some implying oligomerization. However, many questions remain as to the VDAC structure, its supramolecular assembly, packing density, and oligomerization in the MOM is unknown. Here we report the so far highest resolution view of VDAC and its native supramolecular assembly. We have studied yeast MOM by high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) in physiological buffer and found VDAC in two distinct types of membrane domains. We found regions where VDAC was packed at high density (∼80%), rendering the membrane a voltage-dependent molecular sieve. In other domains, VDAC has a low surface density (∼20%) and the pore assembly ranges from single molecules to groups of up to 20. We assume that these groups are mobile in the lipid bilayer and allow association and dissociation with the large assemblies. VDAC has no preferred oligomeric state and no long-range order was observed in densely packed domains. High-resolution topographs show an eye-shaped VDAC with 3.8 nm × 2.7 nm pore dimensions. Based on the observed VDAC structure and the pair correlation function (PCF) analysis of the domain architectures, we propose a simple model that could explain the phase behavior of VDAC, and illustrates the sensitivity of the molecular organization to conditions in the cell, and the possibility for modulation of its assembly. The implication of VDAC in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria during cell apoptosis has made it a target in cancer research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The membrane crystals undergo a lateral phase transition (lattice contraction) that can be induced by an amphipathic polyanion, which also reduces the channel's gating potential. Electron cryo-microscopy of frozen-hydrated crystals indicates that the mean projected diameters of the channels do not decrease with lattice contraction. Instead, contraction is associated with the disappearance of lateral protein "arms" that normally extend between the channels. A model is presented that explains the changes in channel packing and gating potential in terms of a conformational change involving the movement of a protein "arm" between the bilayer and the channel. {\textcopyright} 1993, The Biophysical Society.

Here, we describe a new approach to clustering and variance mapping in the face of these difficulties. The combined subvolume is taken as an estimate of the true subvolume, and the effect of missing data is computed for individual subvolumes. Clustering and variance mapping then proceed based on differences between expected and observed subvolumes.

Functional studies on "condensed" mitochondria isolated from the germ cells of normal rats have been performed. The following parameters have been evaluated: ADP/O ratio, respiratory control ratio (RCR) and ADP affinity. The ADP/O values found in the presence of various substrates are in agreement with the theoretical figures. The RCR is remarkably high. Moreover, the ADP affinity of these mitochondria is very high, as demonstrated by the low values of the "apparent Km".

To probe the role of tetramer assembly, a mutation (Ser58→Trp) was designed to sterically block formation of the dimer-dimer interface near the FBP binding site [Ormo, M., Bystrom, C., and Remington, S. J. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 16565-16572]. The substitution did not substantially change the Michaelis constants or alter allosteric regulation of GK by a second effector, the phosphocarrier protein IIA(Glc); however, it eliminated FBP inhibition. Crystal structures of GK in complex with different nontransferable ATP analogues and glycerol revealed an asymmetric dimer with one subunit adopting an open conformation and the other adopting the closed conformation found in previously determined structures. The conformational difference is produced by a $\sim$6.0°rigid-body rotation of the N-terminal domain with respect to the C-terminal domain, similar to that observed for hexokinase and actin, members of the same ATPase superfamily. Two of the ATP analogues bound in nonproductive conformations in both subunits. However, $\beta$,$\gamma$-difluoromethyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMP-PCF2P), a potent inhibitor of GK, bound nonproductively in the closed subunit and in a putative productive conformation in the open subunit, with the $\gamma$-phosphate placed for in-line transfer to glycerol. This asymmetry is consistent with 'half-of-the-sites' reactivity and suggests that the inhibition of GK by FBP is due to restriction of domain motion.},

Within this reticulum, we find proteins associated with mitochondrial proton-motive force production preferentially in the cell periphery and proteins that use the proton-motive force for ATP production in the cell interior near contractile and transport ATPases. Furthermore, we show a rapid, coordinated depolarization of the membrane potential component of the proton-motive force throughout the cell in response to spatially controlled uncoupling of the cell interior.

The resultant window function has an index k, emulating the characteristics of the Landweber algorithm at the kth iteration. The window function is used to modify the ramp filter in the FBP algorithm. Results: Computer simulations show that the windowed FBP algorithm with window function index k and the iterative Landweber algorithm iteration number k give similar reconstructions in terms of resolution and noise.

D56, 789-790]. To substantiate their assertion, these authors used the Voronoi algorithm to calculate the mean atomic volume for 30 representative protein structures. The Voronoi procedure requires that atoms of interest be bounded on all sides by other atoms. Volume calculations for surface atoms that are not surrounded or are only sparsely surrounded by other atoms either are not possible or may be unreliable. In an attempt to circumvent this problem, Andersson and Hovmoller rejected atoms with calculated volumes that were indeterminate or were greater than 50 {\AA}3. In the present study, it is shown that this criterion is not sufficiently restrictive to ensure accurate volume determinations. When only strictly buried atoms are included in the volume calculations using the Voronoi algorithm, the mean density is found to be 1.47 ± 0.05 g cm-3. In addition, an alternate procedure based on the Connolly algorithm that permits all protein atoms to be included in volume calculations gives 1.43 ± 0.03 g cm-3 for the mean density of the same set of proteins. The latter two calculated values are mutually consistent and are in better agreement with the experimental value.},

Microarray analysis identified glycerol kinase (GK) as the second most highly upregulated gene in Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes with no expression detectable in asexual blood stage parasites. Phosphorylation of glycerol by GK is the rate-limiting step in glycerol utilization. Deletion of this gene from P. falciparum had no effect on asexual parasite growth, but surprisingly also had no effect on gametocyte development or exflagellation, suggesting that these life cycle stages do not utilize host-derived glycerol as a carbon source. Kinetic studies of purified PfGK showed that the enzyme is not regulated by fructose 1,6 bisphosphate. The high-resolution crystal structure of P. falciparum GK, the first of a eukaryotic GK, reveals two domains embracing a capacious ligand-binding groove. In the complexes of PfGK with glycerol and ADP, we observed closed and open forms of the active site respectively. The 27° domain opening is larger than in orthologous systems and exposes an extensive surface with potential for exploitation in selective inhibitor design should the enzyme prove to be essential in vivo either in the human or in the mosquito. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Post-testicular sperm maturation and storage within the epididymis is a key determinant of gamete quality and fertilization competence. Here we demonstrate that mouse spermatozoa possess a complex small non-protein-coding RNA (sRNA) profile, the composition of which is markedly influenced by their epididymal transit. Thus, although microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly represented in the spermatozoa of the proximal epididymis, this sRNA class is largely diminished in mature spermatozoa of the distal epididymis. Coincident with this, a substantial enrichment in Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) abundance in cauda spermatozoa was detected. Further, features of cauda piRNAs, including; predominantly 29–31 nts in length; preference for uracil at their 5' terminus; no adenine enrichment at piRNA nt 10, and; predominantly mapping to intergenic regions of the mouse genome, indicate that these piRNAs are generated by the PIWIL1-directed primary piRNA production pathway. Accordingly, PIWIL1 was detected via immunoblotting and mass spectrometry in epididymal spermatozoa. These data provide insight into the complexity and dynamic nature of the sRNA profile of spermatozoa and raise the intriguing prospect that piRNAs are generated in situ in maturing spermatozoa. Such information is of particular interest in view of the potential role for paternal sRNAs in influencing conception, embryo development and intergenerational inheritance.},

abstract = {Proper distribution of mitochondria within axons and at synapses is critical for neuronal function. While one-third of axonal mitochondria are mobile, a large proportion remains in a stationary phase. However, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial docking within axons remain elusive. Here, we report a role for axon-targeted syntaphilin (SNPH) in mitochondrial docking through its interaction with microtubules. Axonal mitochondria that contain exogenously or endogenously expressed SNPH lose mobility. Deletion of the mouse snph gene results in a substantially higher proportion of axonal mitochondria in the mobile state and reduces the density of mitochondria in axons. The snph mutant neurons exhibit enhanced short-term facilitation during prolonged stimulation, probably by affecting calcium signaling at presynaptic boutons. This phenotype is fully rescued by reintroducing the snph gene into the mutant neurons. These findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism for controlling mitochondrial docking in axons that has a physiological impact on synaptic function. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Ultrastructural studies have previously suggested potential association of intermediate filaments (IFs) with mitochondria. Thus, we have investigated mitochondrial distribution and function in muscle lacking the IF protein desmin. Immunostaining of skeletal muscle tissue sections, as well as histochemical staining for the mitochondrial marker enzymes cytochrome C oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase, demonstrate abnormal accumulation of subsarcolemmal clumps of mitochondria in predominantly slow twitch skeletal muscle of desmin-null mice. Ultrastructural observation of desmin-null cardiac muscle demonstrates in addition to clumping, extensive mitochondrial proliferation in a significant fraction of the myocytes, particularly after work overload. These alterations are frequently associated with swelling and degeneration of the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial abnormalities can be detected very early, before other structural defects become obvious. To investigate related changes in mitochondrial function, we have analyzed ADP-stimulated respiration of isolated muscle mitochondria, and ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration in situ using saponin skinned muscle fibers. The in vitro maximal rates of respiration in isolated cardiac mitochondria from desmin-null and wild-type mice were similar. However, mitochondrial respiration in situ is significantly altered in desmin-null muscle. Both the maximal rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption and the dissociation constant (K(m)) for ADP are significantly reduced in desmin-null cardiac and soleus muscle compared with controls. Respiratory parameters for desmin-null fast twitch gastrocnemius muscle were unaffected. Additionally, respiratory measurements in the presence of creatine indicate that coupling of creatine kinase and the adenine translocator is lost in desmin-null soleus muscle. This coupling is unaffected in cardiac muscle from desmin-null animals. All of these studies indicate that desmin IFs play a significant role in mitochondrial positioning and respiratory function in Cardiac and skeletal muscle.},

The method uses changes in specimen position at previous tilt angles to predict the position at the current tilt angle. Actual measurement of the position or focus is skipped if the statistical error of the prediction is low enough. This method allows a tilt series to be acquired rapidly when conditions are good but falls back toward the traditional approach of taking focusing and tracking images when necessary. The method has been implemented in a program, SerialEM, that provides an efficient environment for data acquisition. This program includes control of an energy filter as well as a low-dose imaging mode, in which tracking and focusing occur away from the area of interest. The program can automatically acquire a montage of overlapping frames, allowing tomography of areas larger than the field of the CCD camera.

abstract = {By deep-etching and rotary replication of unfixed, non-cryoprotected tissue frozen on a helium-cooled copper block, previously undemonstrable organellar surfaces and intramembranous structures can be examined. Among the more remarkable features of mammalian spermatozoa thus prepared are the highly ordered particulate arrays on the surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane. In the midpiece of the sperm, mitochondria curl around dense fibers and the axoneme. The surface of the mitochondrion that faces the plasmalemma carries closely packed rods in haphazard dispersement, composed of two to four 70-to 80-{\AA} particles, <20 {\AA} apart, while the concave aspect of the organelle contains rods in stepladder pattern. These ladders are parallel, with their paticles in neighboring rungs apparently in register at a 40–45° angle relative to the mitochondrial axis. This organizational disparity between the convex and concave surfaces of the organelle not only affords evidence of a new mitochondrial substructure, but represents a type of topographical heterogeneity rarely found except within specialized areas of the plasma membrane. Other novel findings in the sperm cell include the observation of “lipid” tracts flanking intramembranous particle-strands in the plasmalemma of the cytoplasmic droplet, and a gridiron design on the cytoplasmic faces of the droplet's microcisternae, as well as both within and atop its plasma membrane—a motif consistent with the presence of exocytotic or endocytotic activity in this portion of the cell. Additional recent observations are the differing internal and external periodicities of axonemal microtubules and the subunit structure of rectangles on the tail surface overlying the intramembranous particles of the zipper.},

abstract = {VDAC channels exist in the mitochondrial outer membrane of all eukaryotic organisms. Of the different isoforms present in one organism, it seems that one of these is the canonical VDAC whose properties and 3D structure are highly conserved. The fundamental role of these channels is to control the flux of metabolites between the cytosol and mitochondrial spaces. Based on many functional studies, the fundamental structure of the pore wall consists of one $\alpha$ helix and 13 $\beta$ strands tilted at a 46° angle. This results in a pore with an estimated internal diameter of 2.5 nm. This structure has not yet been resolved. The published 3D structure consists of 19 $\beta$ strands and is different from the functional structure that forms voltage-gated channels. The selectivity of the channel is exquisite, being able to select for ATP over molecules of the same size and charge. Voltage gating involves two separate gating processes. The mechanism involves the translocation of a positively charged portion of the wall of the channel to the membrane surface resulting in a reduction in pore diameter and volume and an inversion in ion selectivity. This mechanism is consistent with experiments probing changes in selectivity, voltage gating, kinetics and energetics. Other published mechanisms are in conflict with experimental results.

abstract = {We demonstrated previously that a knockout (KO) of the lactate dehydrogenase type C (Ldhc) gene disrupted male fertility and caused a considerable reduction in sperm glucose consumption, ATP production, and motility. While that study used mice with a mixed genetic background, the present study used C57BL/6 (B6) and 129S6 (129) Ldhc KO mice. We found that B6 KO males were subfertile and 129 KO males were infertile. Sperm from 129 wild-type (WT) mice have a lower glycolytic rate than sperm from B6 WT mice, resulting in a greater reduction in ATP production in 129 KO sperm than in B6 KO sperm. The lower glycolytic rate in 129 sperm offered a novel opportunity to examine the role of mitochondrial respiration in sperm ATP production and motility. We observed that in media containing a mitochondrial substrate (pyruvate or lactate) as the sole energy source, ATP levels and progressive motility in 129 KO sperm were similar to those in 129 WT sperm. However, when glucose was added, lactate was unable to maintain ATP levels or progressive motility in 129 KO sperm. The rate of respiration (ZO2) was high when 129 KO or WT sperm were incubated with lactate alone, but addition of glucose caused a reduction in ZO2. These results indicate that in the absence of glucose, 129 sperm can produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, but in the presence of glucose, oxidative phosphorylation is suppressed and the sperm utilize aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the Crabtree effect.},

abstract = {The relative importance of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) 1 and PMCA4 was assessed in mice carrying null mutations in their genes (Atp2b1 and Atp2b4). Loss of both copies of the gene encoding PMCA1 caused embryolethality, whereas heterozygous mutants had no overt disease phenotype. Despite widespread and abundant expression of PMCA4, PMCA4 null (Pmca4 -/-) mutants exhibited no embryolethality and appeared outwardly normal. Loss of PMCA4 impaired phasic contractions and caused apoptosis in portal vein smooth muscle in vitro; however, this phenotype was dependent on the mouse strain being employed. Pmca4-/- mice on a Black Swiss background did not exhibit the phenotype unless they also carried a null mutation in one copy of the Pmca1 gene. Pmca4-/- male mice were infertile but had normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior. Pmca4 -/- sperm that had not undergone capacitation exhibited normal motility but could not achieve hyperactivated motility needed to traverse the female genital tract. Ultrastructure of the motility apparatus in Pmca4 -/- sperm tails was normal, but an increased incidence of mitochondrial condensation indicated Ca2+ overload. Immunoblotting and immuno-histochemistry showed that PMCA4 is the most abundant isoform in testis and sperm and that it is localized to the principle piece of the sperm tail, which is also the location of the major Ca2+ channel (CatSper) required for sperm motility. These results are consistent with an essential housekeeping or developmental function for PMCA1, but not PMCA4, and show that PMCA4 expression in the principle piece of the sperm tail is essential for hyperactivated motility and male fertility.},

All the spermatocyte-specific GPx4 knock-out male mice were found to be infertile despite normal plug formation after mating and displayed a significant decrease in the number of spermatozoa. Isolated epididymal GPx4-null spermatozoa could not fertilize oocytes in vitro. These spermatozoa showed significant reductions of forward motility and the mitochondrial membrane potential. These impairments were accompanied by the structural abnormality, such as a hairpin-like flagella bend at the midpiece and swelling of mitochondria in the spermatozoa. These results demonstrate that the depletion of GPx4 in spermatocytes causes severe abnormalities in spermatozoa.

abstract = {The voltage-dependent, anion-selective channel (VDAC) is generally considered the main pathway for metabolite diffusion across the mitochondrial outer membrane. It also interacts with several mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins, including kinases and cytochrome c. Sequence analysis and circular dichroism suggest that the channel is a bacterial porin-like $\beta$-barrel. However, unlike bacterial potins, VDAC does not form tight trimeric complexes and is easily gated (reversibly closed) by membrane potential and low pH. Circular dichroism indicates that the protein undergoes a major conformational change at pH <5, involving decreased $\beta$-sheet and increased $\alpha$-helical content. Electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals of fungal VDAC provides direct information about the size and shape of its lumen and suggests that the N-terminal domain forms a mobile $\alpha$-helix. It is proposed that the N-terminal domain normally resides in a groove in the lumen wall and that gating stimuli favor its displacement, destabilizing the putative $\beta$- barrel. Partial closure would result from subsequent larger-scale structural rearrangements in the protein, possibly corresponding to the conformational change observed at pH <5.},

abstract = {Kinesin light chain 3 (KLC3) is the only known kinesin light chain expressed in post-meiotic male germ cells. We have reported that in rat spermatids KLC3 associates with outer dense fibers and mitochondrial sheath. KLC3 is able to bind to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo employing the conserved tetratrico-peptide repeat kinesin light chain motif. The temporal expression and association of KLC3 with mitochondria coincides with the stage in spermatogenesis when mitochondria move from the spermatid cell periphery to the developing midpiece suggesting a role in midpiece formation. In fibroblasts, expression of KLC3 results in formation of large KLC3 aggregates close to the nucleus that contain mitochondria. However, the molecular basis of the aggregation of mitochondria by KLC3 and its role in sperm tail midpiece formation are not clear.Here we show that KLC3 expression from an inducible system causes mitochondrial aggregation within 6. h in a microtubule dependent manner. We identified the mitochondrial outer membrane porin protein VDAC2 as a KLC3 binding partner. To analyze a role for KLC3 in spermatids we developed a transgenic mouse model in which a KLC3$\delta$HR mutant protein is specifically expressed in spermatids: this KLC3 mutant protein binds mitochondria and causes aggregate formation, but cannot bind outer dense fibers. Male transgenic mice display significantly reduced reproductive efficiency siring small sized litters. We observed defects in the mitochondrial sheath structure in a number of transgenic spermatids. Transgenic males have a significantly reduced sperm count and produce spermatozoa that exhibit abnormal motility parameters. Our results indicate that KLC3 plays a role during spermiogenesis in the development of the midpiece and in the normal function of spermatozoa. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been identified as the main fibrogenic cell type in the liver. Hence, efforts to understand hepatic fibrogenesis and to develop treatment strategies have focused on this cell type. HSC isolation, originally developed in rats, has subsequently been adapted to mice, thus allowing the study of fibrogenesis by genetic approaches in transgenic mice. However, mouse HSC isolation is commonly hampered by low yield and purity. Here we present an easy-to-perform protocol for high-purity and high-yield isolation of quiescent and activated HSCs in mice, based on retrograde pronase-collagenase perfusion of the liver and subsequent density-gradient centrifugation. We describe an optional add-on protocol for ultrapure HSC isolation from normal and fibrotic livers via subsequent flow cytometric sorting, thus providing a validated method to determine gene expression changes during HSC activation devoid of cell culture artifacts or contamination with other cells. The described isolation procedure takes ∼4 h to complete.},

abstract = {African trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness in humans or nagana in animals, is a potentially fatal neglected tropical disease and a threat to 65 million human lives and 100 million small and large livestock animals in sub-Saharan Africa. Available treatments for this devastating disease are few and have limited efficacy, prompting the search for new drug candidates. Simultaneous inhibition of the trypanosomal glycerol kinase (TGK) and trypanosom alalternative oxidase (TAO) is considered a validated strategy toward the development of new drugs. Our goal is to develop a TGK-specific inhibitor for coadministration with ascofuranone (AF), the most potent TAO inhibitor. Here, we report on the identification of novel compounds with inhibitory potency against TGK. Importantly, one of these compounds (compound 17) and its derivatives (17a and 17b) killed trypanosomes even in the absence of AF. Inhibition kinetics revealed that derivative 17b is a mixed-type and competitive inhibitor for TGK and TAO, respectively. Structural data revealed the molecular basis of this dual inhibitory action, which, in our opinion, will aid in the successful development of a promising drug to treat trypanosomiasis. Although the EC50 of compound 17b against trypanosome cells was 1.77 $\mu$M, it had no effect on cultured human cells, even at 50 $\mu$M.—Balogun, E. O., Inaoka, D.

abstract = {Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has received considerable interest, owing to its potential to investigate protein–protein interactions (PPIs) in an unbiased fashion in complex protein mixtures. Recent developments have enabled the detection of thousands of PPIs from a single experiment. A unique strength of XL-MS, in comparison with other methods for determining PPIs, is that it provides direct spatial information for the detected interactions. This is accomplished by the use of bifunctional cross-linking molecules that link two amino acids in close proximity with a covalent bond. Upon proteolytic digestion, this results in two newly linked peptides, which are identifiable by MS. XL-MS has received the required boost to tackle more-complex samples with recent advances in cross-linking chemistry with MS-cleavable or reporter-based cross-linkers and faster, more sensitive and more versatile MS platforms. This protocol provides a detailed description of our optimized conditions for a full-proteome native protein preparation followed by cross-linking using the gas-phase cleavable cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO). Following cross-linking, we demonstrate extensive sample fractionation and substantially simplified data analysis with XlinkX in Proteome Discoverer, as well as subsequent protein structure investigations with DisVis and HADDOCK. This protocol produces data of high confidence and can be performed within $\sim$10 d, including structural investigations.},

abstract = {Mouse sperm produce enough ATP to sustain motility by anaerobic glycolysis and respiration. However, previous studies indicated that an active glycolytic pathway is required to achieve normal sperm function and identified glycolysis as the main source of ATP to fuel the motility of mouse sperm. All the available evidence has been gathered from the studies performed using the laboratory mouse. However, comparative studies of closely related mouse species have revealed a wide range of variation in sperm motility and ATP production and that the laboratory mouse has comparatively low values in these traits. In this study, we compared the relative reliance on the usage of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation as ATP sources for sperm motility between mouse species that exhibit significantly different sperm performance parameters. We found that the sperm of species with higher oxygen consumption/lactate excretion rate ratios were able to produce higher amounts of ATP, achieving higher swimming velocities. Additionally, we show that the species with higher respiration/glycolysis ratios have a higher degree of dependence upon active oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we characterize for the first time two mouse species in which sperm depend on functional oxidative phosphorylation to achieve normal performance. Finally, we discuss that sexual selection could promote adaptations in sperm energetic metabolism tending to increase the usage of a more efficient pathway for the generation of ATP (and faster sperm).},

Setting: Academic research laboratory. Animal(s): Male ICR and female B6D2F1/CrljOri mice (8-12 weeks old). Intervention(s): Female mice were superovulated with 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin given IP and 5 IU of hCG given IP 48 hours later. Oocytes were applied to assess fertilization and embryo development. Main Outcome Measure(s): Immunofluorescence assay, computer-Assisted sperm analysis, hypo-osmotic swelling test, combined Hoechst 33258/chlortetracycline fluorescence assessment of capacitation status, measurement of [Ca2+]i and [pH]i, Western blotting, and IVF. Result(s): VDAC2 was localized on the acrosomal region and principal piece, while VDAC3 was localized on the acrosomal region and midpiece. Blocking VDAC with DIDS (500 $\mu$M) significantly decreased motility, viability, acrosome reaction, capacitation, tyrosine phosphorylation, fertilization, and embryo development regardless of Ca2+. However, the most severe decreases were observed in the presence (+) of DIDS and absence (-) of Ca2+, respectively. A significant decrease in [Ca 2+]i concentration was observed in (-) DIDS, while [pH]i was significantly increased in (-) DIDS regardless of Ca 2+. However, a significantly elevated [pH]i was observed in (+) Ca2+. Conclusion(s): Abnormal regulation of VDACs negatively affected sperm function. Thus, VDACs may be key regulators of the fertilization ability of spermatozoa.},

Male infertility has been linked to mitochondrial disorder, for example, hypospermatogenesis and asthenozoospermia. However, the mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial dynamics during spermiogenesis remain largely unknown. We found the glycerol kinase (Gyk)-like proteins glycerol kinase-like 1 (Gykl1) and glycerol kinase 2 (Gk2) were specifically localized to the mitochondria in spermatids. Male mice deficient in either Gykl1 or Gk2 were infertile due to dysfunctional spermatozoa, which exhibited unregulated ATP production, disordered mitochondrial sheath formation, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and defective sperm tail. We demonstrated that the unique C-terminal sequences found in Gykl1 and Gk2 mediated their targeting to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Furthermore, both Gykl1 and Gk2 could interact with Pld6 (MitoPLD) and induce Pld6 and phosphatidic acid (PA)-dependent mitochondrial clustering in cells. Taken together, our study has revealed previously unsuspected functions of Gyk-like proteins in spermiogenesis, providing new insight into the potential mechanisms that lead to spermatozoa dysfunction and male infertility.},

We produced seven mutants, each having an ancestral-consensus amino acid residue that might be present in the common ancestors of both bacteria and of archaea, and that appeared most frequently at the position of 17 glycerol kinase sequences in the multiple sequence alignment. The thermal stabilities of the resulting mutants were assessed by determining their melting temperatures (Tm), which was defined as the temperature at which 50% of the initial catalytic activity is lost after 15 min of incubation, as well as when the half-life of the catalytic activity occurs at a temperature of 60°C (t1/2). Three mutants showed increased stabilities compared to the wild-type protein. We then produced five more mutants with multiple amino acid substitutions. Some of the resulting mutants showed thermal stabilities much greater than those expected given the stabilities of the respective mutants with single mutations. Therefore, the effects of mutations are not always simply additive and some amino acid substitutions, which do not affect or only slightly improve stability when individually introduced into the protein, show substantial stabilizing effects in combination with other mutations.},

In total, we identify 3,322 unique residue-to-residue contacts involving half of the mitochondrial proteome detected by bottom-up proteomics. The obtained mitochondrial protein interactome gives insights in the architecture and submitochondrial localization of defined protein assemblies, and reveals the mitochondrial localization of four proteins not yet included in the MitoCarta database. As one of the highlights, we show that the oxidative phosphorylation complexes I-V exist in close spatial proximity, providing direct evidence for supercomplex assembly in intact mitochondria.

abstract = {Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), also known as mitochondrial porins, are small channel proteins involved in the translocation of metabolites across the mitochondrial outer membrane. A single channel-forming protein is found in yeast, whereas higher eukaryotes express multiple VDACs, with humans and mice each harboring three distinct channels (VDAC1-3) encoded by separate genes. To begin to assess the functions of each of the three isoforms, the VDAC3 gene was inactivated by targeted disruption in embryonic stem cells. Here we show that mice lacking VDAC3 are healthy, but males are infertile. Although there are normal sperm numbers, the sperm exhibit markedly reduced motility. Structural defects were found in two-thirds of epididymal axonemes, with the most common abnormality being loss of a single microtubule doublet at a conserved position within the axoneme. In testicular sperm, the defect was only rarely observed, suggesting that instability of a normally formed axoneme occurs with sperm maturation. In contrast, tracheal epithelial cilia showed no structural abnormalities. In addition, skeletal muscle mitochondria were abnormally shaped, and activities of the respiratory chain complexes were reduced. These results demonstrate that axonemal defects may be caused by associated non-axonemal components such as mitochondrial channels and illustrate that normal mitochondrial function is required for stability of the axoneme.},

abstract = {Axonal mitochondria are recruited to synaptic terminals in response to neuronal activity, but the mechanisms underlying activity-dependent regulation of mitochondrial transport are largely unknown. In this paper, using genetic mouse model combined with live imaging, we demonstrate that syntaphilin (SNPH) mediates the activity-dependent immobilization of axonal mitochondria through binding to KIF5. In vitro analysis showed that the KIF5-SNPH coupling inhibited the motor adenosine triphosphatase. Neuronal activity further recruited SNPH to axonal mitochondria. This motor-docking interplay was induced by Ca2+ and synaptic activity and was necessary to establish an appropriate balance between motile and stationary axonal mitochondria. Deleting snph abolished the activity-dependent immobilization of axonal mitochondria. We propose an "Engine-Switch and Brake" model, in which SNPH acts both as an engine off switch by sensing mitochondrial Rho guanosine triphosphatase-Ca2+ and as a brake by anchoring mitochondria to the microtubule track. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insight into the molecular interplay between motor and docking proteins, which arrests axonal mitochondrial transport in response to changes in neuronal activity.},

abstract = {Isolated mitochondria are capable of undergoing dramatic reversible ultrastructural transformations between a condensed and an orthodox conformation. These two conformations are the extremes in ultrastructural organization between which structually and functionally intact mitochondria transform during reversible respiratory cycles. It has been found that electron transport is required for the condensed-to-orthodox ultrastructural transformation which occurs in mitochondria under State IV conditions, i.e., under conditions in which exogenous substrate is present and ADP is deficient. Inhibition of State IV electron transport at the cyanide-, antimycin A-, or Amytal-sensitive sites in the respiratory chain results in inhibition of this transformation. Resumption of electron transport in initially inhibited mitochondrial systems, initiated by channeling electrons through pathways which bypass the inhibited sites, results in resumption of the ultrastructural transformation. The condensed-to-orthodox transformation is DNP insensitive and, therefore, does not require participation of the coupling enzymes of the energy-transfer pathway. It is concluded that this ultrastructural transformation is manifest by the conversion of the chemical energy of electron transport directly into mechanical work. The reversed ultrastructural transformation, i.e., orthodox-to-condensed, which occurs during ADP-activated State III electron transport, is inhibited by DNP and parallels suppression of acceptor control and oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanochemical ultrastructural transformation as a basis for energy transfer in mitochondria is considered with respect to the results presented.},

Subsequently, crescent-like mitochondria elongate continuously to coil tightly around the flagellum.

To analyze the disorganization of the mitochondrial sheath further, we generated Gk2-deficient mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and observed sperm mitochondria in testis using a freeze-fracture method with scanning electron microscopy. Gk2-disrupted spermatids show abnormal localization of crescent-like mitochondria, in spite of the initial proper alignment of spherical mitochondria around the flagellum, which causes abnormal mitochondrial sheath formation leading to exposure of the outer dense fibers.

Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically "freeze" while their "pictures are taken." However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent advances in this exciting field and considers some of the basic lessons learned from the analysis of physics, chemistry, and biology of IDPs.},

abstract = {We describe a phase plate for transmission electron microscopy taking advantage of a hitherto-unknown phenomenon, namely a beam-induced Volta potential on the surface of a continuous thin film. The Volta potential is negative, indicating that it is not caused by beam-induced electrostatic charging. The film must be heated to ∼ 200 °C to prevent contamination and enable the Volta potential effect. The phase shift is created "on the fly" by the central diffraction beam eliminating the need for precise phase plate alignment. Images acquired with the Volta phase plate (VPP) show higher contrast and unlike Zernike phase plate images no fringing artifacts. Following installation into the microscope, the VPP has an initial settling time of about a week after which the phase shift behavior becomes stable. The VPP has a long service life and has been used for more than 6 mo without noticeable degradation in performance. The mechanism underlying the VPP is the same as the one responsible for the degradation over time of the performance of thin-film Zernike phase plates, but in the VPP it is used in a constructive way. The exact physics and/or chemistry behind the process causing the Volta potential are not fully understood, but experimental evidence suggests that radiation-induced surface modification combined with a chemical equilibrium between the surface and residual gases in the vacuum play an important role.},

abstract = {Mitochondria in many types of cells are dynamically interconnected through constant fusion and fission, allowing for exchange of mitochondrial contents and repair of damaged mitochondria. However, constrained by the myofibril lattice, the ∼6,000 mitochondria in the adult mammalian cardiomyocyte display little motility, and it is unclear how, if at all, they communicate with each other. By means of target-expressing photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PAGFP) in the mitochondrial matrix or on the outer mitochondrial membrane, we demonstrated that the local PAGFP signal propagated over the entire population of mitochondria in cardiomyocytes on a time scale of ∼10 h. Two elemental steps of intermitochondrial communications were manifested as either a sudden PAGFP transfer between a pair of adjacent mitochondria (i.e., "kissing") or a dynamic nanotubular tunnel (i.e., " nanotunneling") between nonadjacent mitochondria. The average content transfer index (fractional exchange) was around 0.5; the rate of kissing was 1%s-1 per mitochondrial pair, and that of nanotunneling was about 14 times smaller. Electron microscopy revealed extensive intimate contacts between adjacent mitochondria and elongated nanotubular protrusions, providing a structural basis for the kissing and nanotunneling, respectively. We propose that, through kissing and nanotunneling, the otherwise static mitochondria in a cardiomyocyte form one dynamically continuous network to share content and transfer signals.},

abstract = {Glycerol kinase catalyzes the metabolism of endogenously derived and dietary glycerol. GyK is a member of a small group of kinases termed ambiquitous enzymes, which are found either in the cytosol or as membrane- bound complexes associated with the voltage-dependent anion channel of the mitochondrial outer membrane. In Homo sapiens, the GyK gene family consists of an X-encoded locus and several X-linked and autosomal intronless retroposons, which, apparently, comprise both functional genes and processed pseudogenes. To study the role of the autosomal genes in mammalian physiology, we have isolated two murine GyK-like genes, determined their structures and chromosomal locations, and examined their functions. These sequences are intronless retroposons, which appear to be paralogues of the X- encoded, brain-specific GyK isoform and are expressed only in the testes. Though both retrotransposition events appear to have occurred prior to the primate-rodent divergence of some 65-80 million years ago, only one of the retrotransposed murine gene sequences, based upon its chromosomal location, is conserved with modern H. sapiens. To test the hypothesis that the murine GyK-like genes encode functional GyK activity, transient transfection of the gene sequences into COS7 cells was carried out. While in vitro translation confirmed that the transcripts could direct the synthesis of proteins of the appropriate size, no GyK activity was detected. Such data suggest that the autosomal GyK-like genes have evolved novel, testis-specific functions. A comparison of the human and mouse GyK-like gene sequences demonstrates the evolutionary relationships between each autosomal isoform and its corresponding X-linked ancestral locus.},

Recent findings show that mitochondria communicate at a distance with each other via nanotunnels, thin double-membrane protrusions that connect the matrices of non-adjacent mitochondria. Emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial nanotunnels are generated by immobilized mitochondria and transport proteins. This review integrates data from the evolutionarily conserved structure and function of intercellular projections in bacteria with recent developments in mitochondrial imaging that permit nanotunnel visualization in eukaryotes. Cell type-specificity, timescales, and the selective size-based diffusion of biomolecules along nanotunnels are also discussed. The joining of individual mitochondria into dynamic networks of communicating organelles via nanotunnels and other mechanisms has major implications for organelle and cellular behaviors.},

abstract = {Electron cryotomography provides a means of studying the three dimensional structure of pleomorphic objects, such as organelles or cells, with a resolution of 1-3. nm. A limitation in the study of radiation sensitive biological samples is the low signal-to-noise ratio of the tomograms which may obscure fine details. To overcome this limitation, the recently developed Volta phase plate (VPP) was applied in electron cryotomographic studies of a wide range of cellular structures, from magnetotactic bacteria to primary cultured neurons. The results show that the VPP improves contrast significantly and consequently the signal-to-noise ratio of the tomograms, moreover it avoids disturbing fringing artifacts typical for Zernike phase plates. The contrast improvement provided by the VPP was also confirmed in projection images of relatively thick ($\sim$400. nm) samples. In order to investigate the respective contributions of the VPP and the energy filter, images acquired with different combinations of the two were compared. Zero-loss energy filtering reduced the background noise in thicker areas of the sample and improved the contrast of features such as poly-$\beta$-hydroxybutyrate granules in magnetotactic bacteria, whereas the VPP provided an overall contrast improvement for all sample areas. After 3D reconstruction, tomograms acquired with the combination of a VPP and an energy filter showed structural features in neuronal processes with outstanding clarity. We also show that the VPP can be combined with focused ion beam milling to examine structures embedded deeply inside cells. Thus, we expect that VPP will become a standard element of the electron cryotomography workflow.},

The observation of oxidative stress in keratinocytes from Krt16 null mouse skin, a model for pachyonychia congenita (PC)-associated palmoplantar keratoderma, prompted us to examine the role of Keratin (K) 16 protein and its partner K6 in regulating the structure and function of mitochondria. Electron microscopy revealed major anomalies in mitochondrial ultrastructure in late stage, E18.5, Krt6a/Krt6b null embryonic mouse skin. Follow-up studies utilizing biochemical, metabolic, and live imaging readouts showed that, relative to controls, skin keratinocytes null for Krt6a/Krt6b or Krt16 exhibit elevated ROS, reduced mitochondrial respiration, intracellular distribution differences, and altered movement of mitochondria within the cell. These findings highlight a novel role for K6 and K16 in regulating mitochondrial morphology, dynamics, and function and shed new light on the causes of oxidative stress observed in PC and related keratin-based skin disorders.},

Each of these operations raises serious difficulties that have now been overcome. In general, the native state seen with CEMOVIS is very different from what has been seen before and it is seen in more detail.

We have investigated the protein composition of purified ODF from bovine spermatozoa and found that one of the most abundant proteins is a 30-32-kDa polypeptide. This protein was analyzed by sequencing peptides derived following limited proteolysis. Peptide sequences were found to match VDAC2 and VDAC3. VDACs (voltage-dependent, anion-selective channels) or eukaryotic porins are a group of proteins first identified in the mitochondrial outer membrane that are able to form hydrophilic pore structures in membranes. In mammals, three VDAC isoforms (VDAC1, -2, -3) have been identified by cDNA cloning and sequencing. Antibodies against synthetic peptides specific for the three mammal VDAC isoforms were generated in rabbits. Their specificity was demonstrated by immunoblotting using recombinant VDAC1, -2, and -3. In protein extracts of bovine spermatozoa, VDAC1, -2, and -3 were detected by specific antibodies, while only VDAC2 and -3 were found as solubilized proteins derived from purified bovine ODFs. Immunofluorescence microscopy of spermatozoa revealed that anti-VDAC2 and anti-VDAC3 antibodies clearly bound to the sperm flagellum, in particular to the ODF. Transmission electron immunomicroscopy supported the finding that VDAC2 protein is abundant in the-ODF. Since the ODF does not have any known membranous structure, it is tempting to speculate that VDAC2 and VDAC3 might have an alternative structural organization and different functions in ODF than in mitochondria.},

We implement this method to investigate mitochondrial motility and positioning in cultured neurons. Using zapalog, we tether mitochondria to constitutively active kinesin motors, forcing them down the axon towards microtubule (+) ends until their instantaneous release via blue light, which results in full restoration of their endogenous motility. We find that one-third of stationary mitochondria cannot be pulled away from their position and that these firmly anchored mitochondria preferentially localize to VGLUT1-positive presynapses. Furthermore, inhibition of actin polymerization with latrunculin A reduces this firmly anchored pool. On release from exogenous motors, mitochondria are preferentially recaptured at presynapses.},

In detergent-extracted specimens the SMR remains attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane thereby suggesting a firm structural interaction.

Very few of their spermatozoa can achieve forward progression, but for those that can, we add here the information (1) that the three-dimensional aspects of their movement are normal; (2) that their maximum velocity is less than that of wild-type controls; and (3) that they are entirely unable to penetrate media of raised viscosity (25-4,000 cP). However, the large majority of the spermatozoa can achieve only a low amplitude vibration. In these sperm we find, using electron microscopy, that the outer dense fibres retain attachments to the inner surface of the mitochondria. Such attachments are present in normal epididymal mouse spermatozoa but are broken down as soon as the sperm become motile on release from the epididymis. The attachments are presumed to be essential during midpiece development and, afterwards, to require a threshold level of force to loosen them and so permit the sliding displacements necessary for normal bending. We presume that the disruption of the inner dynein arm heavy chain gene, MDHC7, means that there is insufficient force to overcome the attachments, for all but a few spermatozoa. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {In this study we identify a reticular network of electron-dense material in the spermatozoan midpiece which is immediately peripheral to the outer dense fiber-axoneme complex and is adherent to the overlying mitochondria. This network, termed the submitochondrial lattice, extends throughout the midpiece and terminates at the midpiece-principal piece junction where it fuses to the annulus. In cross sections this material appears as an approximately 10-14-nm-thick, discontinuous layer adherent to the outer mitochondrial membrane; longitudinal sections reveal that the network is arranged as longitudinally oriented electron-dense bands which branch and anastomose laterally to form a cylinder-shaped reticulum. The potential role of this complex in organizing the mitochondrial helix and in maintaining mitochondrial distribution is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {In the middle piece of mouse sperm tail, the idea of the mitochondria wrapping in a sinistral (left-handed) double helical structure was generally accepted. In the existing model, mitochondria aligned in four longitudinal rows (stage 1) and twisted dextrally (right-handed) (stage 2) and began to stagger, where opposing rows of mitochondria contacted each other to form a sinistral double helix (stage 3), finally, the end-on touching mitochondria further elongated to their mature length (stage 4). However, in this model, mitochondria need to shift a long distance and reposition themselves. Since no gaps have been found in mitochondrial sheath, repositioning of most mitochondria along the middle piece is unlikely to happen. Therefore, we reapproached the questions through three-dimensional rendering to provide a new model for mitochondrial sheath formation. In our proposed model, four dextrally arranged spherical mitochondrial arrays were considered stage 1 (resembles stage 2 of the old model). In stage 2 (resembles stage 3 of the old model), a critical difference was found that pairs of mitochondria from the opposing arrays formed ring-like structures instead of a sinistral double helix. In stage 3, which was not observed in the old model, mitochondria staggered in a specific pattern to form the sinistral double helix. In stage 4, mitochondria elongated from crescent-shaped to rod-shaped structures. The new model proposed here would allow each mitochondrion to stay at where they attached first and elongate laterally from two directions to reach their final double helical structure without unreasonable great distance shift along the outer dense fibers.},

abstract = {The mammalian sperm must be highly motile for a long time to fertilize a egg. It has been supposed that ATP required for sperm flagellar movement depends predominantly on mitochondrial respiration. We assessed the contribution of mitochondrial respiration to mouse sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility with high beat frequency in an appropriate solution including a substrate such as glucose. The active sperm contained a large amount of ATP. When carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was applied to suppress the oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria, the vigorous motility was maintained and the amount of ATP was kept at the equivalent level to that without CCCP. When pyruvate or lactate was provided instead of glucose, both sperm motility and the amount of ATP were high. However, they were drastically decreased when oxidative phosphorylation was suppressed by addition of CCCP. We also found that sperm motility could not be maintained in the presence of respiratory substrates when glycolysis was suppressed. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) had no effect on mitochondrial respiration assessed by a fluorescent probe, 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), but, it inhibited motility and decreased ATP content when pyruvate or lactate were provided as substrates. The present results suggest that glycolysis has an unexpectedly important role in providing the ATP required for sperm motility throughout the length of the sperm flagellum.},

We utilized a rapid fixation method to look for differences in the flagellar apparatus that correlate to the state of motility of reactivated sperm models. In a companion article, we examined the motility characteristics induced in bull sperm models by varying the concentration ratio of ATP and Mg2+ and the stabilizing effect of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) on coordinated beating. Based on the results of that report, we selected four dissimilar states that appeared to represent extremes. One reactivation condition produces vigorous motility similar to live sperm, another produces large amplitude, low frequency beating while the remaining two conditions produce small amplitude vibrations of the flagellum with little coordinated beating. Morphometric analysis of transmission electron micrographs of sperm from these four treatment conditions revealed statistically significant differences between the samples in regard to axoneme diameter, inter-microtubule doublet spacing, and outer dense fiber (ODF) spacing. Our results show that Mg2+ decreases the axoneme diameter and reduces interdoublet spacing, while ATP, uncomplexed with Mg2+, had the opposite effect. We also provide supporting evidence that this may be due to Mg2+ increasing, and ATP decreasing, the interdoublet adhesion of dynein. We also found that 4 mM ADP significantly increases the separation between the ODFs and the space between the ODFs and the central axoneme within the middle piece. We present a hypothetical explanation that is consistent with our results to explain how ATP, ADP, and Mg2+ act to regulate the beat cycle.},

abstract = {Boar spermatozoa loaded with the Ca2+ probe fluo‐3 were incubated in various Tyrode's‐based media similar to those used for in vitro fertilization (IVF), and samples were then analysed by two‐colour flow cytometry; propidium iodide was included in the media to detect membrane‐damaged (“dead”) cells. If media contained bicarbonate/CO2 (a component thought to promote capacitation), part of the live sperm population experienced a considerable influx of Ca2+ into both head and tail compartments. The percentage of responding cells reached a maximum after about 30 min, but both during and after this period there was also a steady increase in the number of dead cells. This bicarbonatemediated increase in cell death took place in the absence of external Ca2+. Evidence was obtained that the entry of propidium iodide was preceded by a change in permeability of the plasma membrane, detectable by leakage of carboxydichlorofluorescein, and it was therefore deduced that the Ca2+ influx detected by fluo‐3 was due to destabilization of the plasma membrane. A similar response could be produced by both caffeine and papaverine (best known as phosphodiesterase inhibitors), but neither cyclic AMP nor activators of adenylate cyclase had any effect. There was no influence of substrate on the process, but, in comparison to poly(vinyl alcohol), serum albumin enhanced it. The precise relevance of this destabilization to capacitation is not yet clear, but it seems significant that the process is mediated or enhanced by components often specifically included in IVF media, and that different individual cells respond after different times. {\textcopyright} 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {Mammalian sperm are not able to fertilize immediately upon ejaculation; they become fertilization-competent after undergoing changes in the female reproductive tract collectively termed capacitation. Although it has been established that capacitation is associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, little is known about the role of this event in sperm function. In this work we used a combination of two dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation. Some of the identified proteins are the mouse orthologues of human sperm proteins known to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Among them we identified VDAC, tubulin, PDH E1 $\beta$ chain, glutathione S-transferase, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 6, acrosin binding protein precursor (sp32), proteasome subunit alpha type 6b and cytochrome b-c1 complex. In addition to previously described proteins, we identified two testis-specific aldolases as substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation. Genomic and EST analyses suggest that these aldolases are retroposons expressed exclusively in the testis, as has been reported elsewhere. Because of the importance of glycolysis for sperm function, we hypothesize that tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins can play a role in the regulation of glycolysis during capacitation. However, neither the Km nor the Vmax of aldolase changed as a function of capacitation when its enzymatic activity was assayed in vitro, suggesting other levels of regulation for aldolase function. {\textcopyright} UBC Press.},

abstract = {Selenium is linked to male fertility. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), first described as an antioxidant enzyme, is the predominant selenoenzyme in testis and has been suspected of being vital for spermatogenesis. Cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear isoforms are all encoded by the same gene. While disruption of entire GPx4 causes early embryonic lethality in mice, inactivation of nuclear GPx4 does not impair embryonic development or fertility. Here, we show that deletion of mitochondrial GPx4 (mGPx4) allows both normal embryogenesis and postnatal development, but causes male infertility. Infertility was associated with impaired sperm quality and severe structural abnormalities in the midpiece of spermatozoa. Knockout sperm display higher protein thiol content and recapitulate features typical of severe selenodeficiency. Interestingly, male infertility induced by mGPx4 depletion could be bypassed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. We also show for the first time that mGPx4 is the prevailing GPx4 product in male germ cells and that mGPx4 disruption has no effect on proliferation or apoptosis of germinal or somatic tissue. Our study finally establishes that mitochondrial GPx4 confers the vital role of selenium in mammalian male fertility and identifies cytosolic GPx4 as the only GPx4 isoform being essential for embryonic development and apoptosis regulation. {\textcopyright} FASEB.},

abstract = {The mammalian sperm midpiece has a unique double-helical structure called the mitochondrial sheath that wraps tightly around the axoneme. Despite the remarkable organization of the mitochondrial sheath, the molecular mechanisms involved in mitochondrial sheath formation are unclear. In the process of screening testis-enriched genes for functions in mice, we identified armadillo repeat-containing 12 (ARMC12) as an essential protein for mitochondrial sheath formation. Here, we engineered Armc12 -null mice, FLAG-tagged Armc12 knock-in mice, and TBC1 domain family member 21 ( Tbc1d21 )-null mice to define the functions of ARMC12 in mitochondrial sheath formation in vivo. We discovered that absence of ARMC12 causes abnormal mitochondrial coiling along the flagellum, resulting in reduced sperm motility and male sterility. During spermiogenesis, sperm mitochondria in Armc12 -null mice cannot elongate properly at the mitochondrial interlocking step which disrupts abnormal mitochondrial coiling. ARMC12 is a mitochondrial peripheral membrane protein and functions as an adherence factor between mitochondria in cultured cells. ARMC12 in testicular germ cells interacts with mitochondrial proteins MIC60, VDAC2, and VDAC3 as well as TBC1D21 and GK2, which are required for mitochondrial sheath formation. We also observed that TBC1D21 is essential for the interaction between ARMC12 and VDAC proteins in vivo. These results indicate that ARMC12 uses integral mitochondrial membrane proteins VDAC2 and VDAC3 as scaffolds to link mitochondria and works cooperatively with TBC1D21. Thus, our studies have revealed that ARMC12 regulates spatiotemporal mitochondrial dynamics to form the mitochondrial sheath through cooperative interactions with several proteins on the sperm mitochondrial surface.},

abstract = {An extensive array of reproductive traits varies among species, yet the genetic mechanisms that enable divergence, often over short evolutionary timescales, remain elusive. Here we examine two sister-species of Peromyscus mice with divergent mating systems. We find that the promiscuous species produces sperm with longer midpiece than the monogamous species, and midpiece size correlates positively with competitive ability and swimming performance. Using forward genetics, we identify a gene associated with midpiece length: Prkar1a, which encodes the R1$\alpha$ regulatory subunit of PKA. R1$\alpha$ localizes to midpiece in Peromyscus and is differentially expressed in mature sperm of the two species yet is similarly abundant in the testis. We also show that genetic variation at this locus accurately predicts male reproductive success. Our findings suggest that rapid evolution of reproductive traits can occur through cell type-specific changes to ubiquitously expressed genes and have an important effect on fitness.},

Tubular two-dimensional crystals of the VDAC spontaneously formed after incubation of OMMs for two to three months at 4 °C.

Atomic force microscopy of freshly isolated OMMs demonstrated (i) the existence of monomers to tetramers, hexamers and higher oligomers of the VDAC and (ii) its spatial arrangement within the oligomers in the native membrane.

We present native structures of the flagellar base, which is crucial for shaping the flagellar beat. We show that outer dense fibers are directly coupled to microtubule doublets in the principal piece but not in the midpiece.

These so called cryo-lamellae allow high-resolution structural studies of the natural cellular environment by in situ cryo-electron tomography. However, the cryo-lamella workflow is a low-throughput technique and can easily be obstructed by technical issues like the bending of the lamellae during the final cryo-FIB-milling steps. The severity of lamella bending seems to correlate with shrinkage of the EM grid support film at cryogenic temperatures, which could generate tensions that may be transferred onto the thin lamella, leading to its bending and breakage. To protect the lamellae from these forces, we milled “micro-expansion joints” alongside the lamellae, creating gaps in the support that can act as physical buffers to safely absorb material motion. We demonstrate that the presence of such micro-expansion joints drastically decreases lamella bending. Furthermore, we show that this adaptation does not create instabilities that could constrain subsequent parts of the cryo-lamella workflow, as we obtained high-quality Volta phase plate tomograms revealing macromolecules in their natural structural context. The minimal additional effort required to implement micro-expansion joints in the cryo-FIB-milling workflow makes them an easy solution against cryo-lamella bending in any biological sample milled on EM grids.},

abstract = {To investigate the hypothesis that oxidative phosphorylation is a major source of ATP to fuel stallion sperm motility, oxidative phosphorylation was suppressed using the mitochondrial uncouplers CCCP and 2,4,-dinitrophenol (DNP) and by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration at complex IV using sodium cyanide or at the level of ATP synthase using oligomycin-A. As mitochondrial dysfunction may also lead to oxidative stress, production of reactive oxygen species was monitored simultaneously. All inhibitors reduced ATP content, but oligomycin-A did so most profoundly. Oligomycin-A and CCCP also significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Sperm motility almost completely ceased after the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and both percentage of motile sperm and sperm velocity were reduced in the presence of mitochondrial uncouplers. Inhibition of ATP synthesis resulted in the loss of sperm membrane integrity and increased the production of reactive oxygen species by degenerating sperm. Inhibition of glycolysis by deoxyglucose led to reduced sperm velocities and reduced ATP content, but not to loss of membrane integrity. These results suggest that, in contrast to many other mammalian species, stallion spermatozoa rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy required for instance to maintain a functional Na+/K+ gradient, which is dependent on an Na+-K+ antiporter ATPase, which relates directly to the noted membrane integrity loss. Under aerobic conditions, however, glycolysis also provides the energy required for sperm motility.},

abstract = {Morphologic changes in the development of the mitochondrial helical sheath in the mouse spermatid tail were examined with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) using the osmium‐DMSO‐osmium method and classified into several stages. During late spermiogenesis, spherical mitochondria gathered around the forming spermatid tail. The shape of these mitochondria gradually changed from spheroid to long and rod‐like. Mitochondria first were arranged in four longitudinal rows (stage 1) that twisted dextrally, and the mitochondria began to stagger (stage 2). They became elongated and arranged into a staggered pattern; they then attached to each other in an end‐to‐end fashion to form a sinistral double helix around the core of the axoneme (stage 3). These end‐to‐end contacts were observed in every second gyre on the four lines surrounding the core of the axoneme at stage 3. Mitochondria further elongated and end‐on touching appeared with every third gyre on the five longitudinal lines that surround the core of the axoneme (stage 4). The direction of the helix, always sinistral, was clearly discernible only in the later stages. Disposition of the mitochondria in the spermatid tail was regular throughout development, which indicates that these mitochondria elongate simultaneously and also at the same rate. On any given cracked surface of the seminiferous tubule, spermatid tails with the same stage of mitochondria predominantly were observed. This ultrastructural finding appears compatible with the histologic synchronism, (termed the “wave”) in differentiating germ cells. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1988 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Physiological states of mitochondria often correlate with distinctive morphology. Electron microscopy and tomographic reconstruction were used to investigate the three-dimensional structure of axonal mitochondria and mitochondria in the surrounding Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), both in the vicinity of nodes of Ranvier and far from these nodes. Condensed mitochondria were found to be abundant in the axoplasm, but not in the Schwann cell. Uncharacteristic of the classical morphology of condensed mitochondria, the outer and inner boundary membranes are in close apposition and the crista junctions are narrow, consistent with their function as gates for the diffusion of macromolecules. There is also less cristae surface area and lower density of crista junctions in these mitochondria. The density of mitochondria was greater at the paranode-node-paranode (PNP) as was the crista junction opening, yet there were fewer cristae in these organelles compared to those in the internodal region. The greater density of condensed mitochondria in the PNS axoplasm and in particular at the PNP suggests a need for these organelles to operate at a high workload of ATP production. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Dysfunction of plectin, a 500-kD cytolinker protein, leads to skin blistering and muscular dystrophy. Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we show that plectin deficiency results in progressive degenerative alterations in striated muscle, including aggregation and partial loss of intermediate filament (IF) networks, detachment of the contractile apparatus from the sarcolemma, profound changes in myofiber costameric cytoarchitecture, and decreased mitochondrial number and function. Analysis of newly generated plectin isoform-specific knockout mouse models revealed that IF aggregates accumulate in distinct cytoplasmic compartments, depending on which isoform is missing. Our data show that two major plectin isoforms expressed in muscle, plectin 1d and 1f, integrate fibers by specifically targeting and linking desmin IFs to Z-disks and costameres, whereas plectin 1b establishes a linkage to mitochondria. Furthermore, disruption of Z-disk and costamere linkages leads to the pathological condition of epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy. Our fi ndings establish plectin as the major organizer of desmin IFs in myofibers and provide new insights into plectin- and desmin-related muscular dystrophies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Konieczny et al.
